## 🔬 Overview

Flow Imaging Microscopy (FIM) is a powerful tool for sub-visible particle (SvP) detection in biopharmaceuticals. However, data imbalance—particularly underrepresentation of particle types like silicone oil and air bubbles—hinders the performance of multi-class deep learning classifiers.

In this work, we develop and validate a diffusion-based generative AI approach to synthesize realistic images of underrepresented particle types. We demonstrate that augmenting datasets with these synthetic images significantly improves classification performance across multiple architectures.

## 📌 Key Contributions

- ✅ A **diffusion model** trained on real FIM images of underrepresented particle types (air bubbles and silicone oil).
- ✅ Multi-class **deep neural network classifiers** (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) trained on real and augmented datasets.
- ✅ Public release of all models and generated datasets.
