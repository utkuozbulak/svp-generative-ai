## üî¨ Overview

Flow Imaging Microscopy (FIM) is a powerful tool for sub-visible particle (SvP) detection in biopharmaceuticals. However, data imbalance‚Äîparticularly underrepresentation of particle types like silicone oil and air bubbles‚Äîhinders the performance of multi-class deep learning classifiers.

In this work, we develop and validate a diffusion-based generative AI approach to synthesize realistic images of underrepresented particle types. We demonstrate that augmenting datasets with these synthetic images significantly improves classification performance across multiple architectures.

## üìå Key Contributions

- ‚úÖ A **diffusion model** trained on 64x64 real FIM images of underrepresented particle types (air bubbles and silicone oil).
- ‚úÖ Multi-class **deep neural network classifiers** (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) trained on real and augmented datasets.
- ‚úÖ Public release of all models and generated datasets.

## üõ† Models and Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
* **Code** - *src/* folder contains two subfolders: diffusion_code and classification_code, which contains code for their respective models

*src/diffusion_code* contains code to load and generate images from the difussion model

*src/classification_code* contains code to load classification models

* **Data** - *data/* folder contains a txt file with the appropriate link to the generated data, you can download this data and use it.
