**Improved Sub-Visible Particle Classification in Flow Imaging Microscopy via Generative AI-Based Image Synthesis**

## üî¨ Overview

Flow Imaging Microscopy (FIM) is a powerful tool for sub-visible particle (SvP) detection in biopharmaceuticals. However, data imbalance, particularly underrepresentation of particle types such as silicone oil and air bubbles, hinders the performance of multi-class deep learning classifiers.

In this work, we develop and validate a diffusion-based generative AI approach to synthesize realistic images of underrepresented particle types. We demonstrate that augmenting datasets with these synthetic images improves classification performance across multiple architectures.

## üìå Key Contributions

- ‚úÖ Diffusion models trained on 64√ó64 real FIM images of underrepresented particle types (air bubbles and silicone oil) that can generate high-fidelity, diverse synthetic samples to address data imbalance.
- ‚úÖ Classificaiton models (ResNets) with > 95% Positive predictive value (PPV) for each class (protein particles, air bubbles, silicone oil) evaluated on 500k protein particles.
- ‚úÖ Public release of all models and generated datasets.

## üõ† Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
* **Code** - *src/* folder contains two subfolders: diffusion_code and classification_code, which contains code for their respective models

*src/diffusion_code* contains code to load and generate images from the difussion model

*src/classification_code* contains code to load classification models

* **Data** - *data/* folder contains a txt file with the appropriate link to the generated data, you can download this data and use it.
