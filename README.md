## üî¨ Overview

Flow Imaging Microscopy (FIM) is a powerful tool for sub-visible particle (SvP) detection in biopharmaceuticals. However, data imbalance, particularly underrepresentation of particle types such as silicone oil and air bubbles, hinders the performance of multi-class deep learning classifiers.

In this work, we develop and validate a diffusion-based generative AI approach to synthesize realistic images of underrepresented particle types. We demonstrate that augmenting datasets with these synthetic images improves classification performance across multiple architectures.

## üìå Key Contributions

- ‚úÖ A **diffusion model** trained on 64x64 real FIM images of underrepresented particle types (air bubbles and silicone oil).
- ‚úÖ Multi-class deep neural network classifiers (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50), trained on real and augmented datasets, achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in three-class classification (protein particles, air bubbles, silicone oil), with a positive predictive value exceeding 95% for each class, evaluated on 500,000 protein particles.
- ‚úÖ Public release of all models and generated datasets.
